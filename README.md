# **Recursion**

## **Description**

This repository contains a Java application that demonstrates the concept of recursion through two parts of a program. The program includes examples and exercises to illustrate how recursion works and its applications in solving various problems. This project serves as a hands-on resource for learning and mastering recursion in Java.

## **Features**

- **Recursion Examples**: Includes practical examples of recursive functions, demonstrating different use cases.
- **Exercises**: Exercises to challenge and deepen understanding of recursion.
- **Clear Explanations**: Each example and exercise comes with an explanation to help users understand recursion better.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- **Java** installed on your system.
- An IDE like **NetBeans** for running the project.

### Steps to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., **NetBeans**).
3. Explore the folders for examples and exercises:

   - **Recursion-I/**: Contains the first part of the program with introductory recursion examples.
   - **Recursion-II/**: Contains the second part, expanding on recursion concepts and exercises.
4. Compile and run the Java files to see recursion in action.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Java**: The programming language used for demonstrating recursion.
- **NetBeans**: IDE used for development and managing the project.

## **File Structure**

- **`Recursion-I/`**: Folder containing the first part of the recursion program, including examples and exercises.
- **`Recursion-II/`**: Folder containing the second part of the recursion program, further exploring recursion concepts.
- **`.DS_Store`**: macOS system file (can be ignored).
- **`README.md`** : Documentation file with project details and instructions.

## **Usage**

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as **NetBeans**.
2. Navigate to the **Recursion-I/** and **Recursion-II/** folders to explore the examples and exercises.
3. Compile and run the Java files to observe recursion in action.
4. Modify the code to experiment with recursion and deepen your understanding.
